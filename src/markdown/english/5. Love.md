Sex isn’t fulfilling, intimacy is. Intimacy is actually an emotional need, not just physical, even for men. Porn does not provide intimacy, it keeps you from finding it.

When sex is natural and normal it is a game played according to rules that you make up yourselves without giving a moment’s thought to how others do it or how it is supposed to be done.

Fixating on the naked, sexual parts of women dulls your ability to appreciate the beauty of their smile, or their eyes lighting up when they talk or laugh. After quitting porn, you will be amazed how beautiful real, everyday women are — even with their clothes on!

A lot of external battles happen because your internal state is not good. When you’re naturally internally peaceful you’re going to pick fewer fights. You’re going to be more loving without expecting anything in return. That will take care of things on the external-relationship front.

## Fear Of Love

Some who leave porn or who practice semen retention gain an unhealthy view on relationships. In their attempt to leave porn, they block out all sexual thoughts, and they numb themselves into a weird state where they are fearing visiting social media or they avoid women. This fear only creates disadvantages.

If you partake in this unhealthy view on relationships where you fear anything sexual or intimate, your body can go, "Hey, I guess we're just not going to have sex. We're not going to be able to masturbate, etc". Avoidance of intimacy and love can cause you to become more submissive and it can cause your libido to go down.

Instead of the toxic idea that blocking out something and fearing it will help anything, you should instead build up a healthy view on what relationships truly mean, and the value of a loving partner.

## Obsession

On one end there is fear of love, and then on the other, there is obsession.
