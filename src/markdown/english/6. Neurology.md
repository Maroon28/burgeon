interaction with thoughts

((fear))

Just because you accidentally see porn or someone naked, does not create negative dopamine effect. Actively seeking porn or lewd material for pleasure does.

((emotion))

An emotion is our evolved biology predicting the future impact of a current event. In modern settings, it’s usually exaggerated or wrong.

((habitual pathways))

Habits are everything—everything we are. We are trained in habits from when we are children, including potty training, when to cry and when not to, how to smile and when not to. These things become habits—behaviors we learn and integrate into ourselves. 

When we’re older, we’re a collection of thousands of habits constantly running subconsciously. We have a little bit of extra brainpower in our neocortex for solving new problems. You become your habits.

"You have to take a second to sit down, to thoroughly observe your patterns. Do you move when you don't want to move, do you get angry when you don't want to get angry; you have to fix these things about yourself, you have to give a fuck about yourself and that makes life so much better." - XXXTentacion
