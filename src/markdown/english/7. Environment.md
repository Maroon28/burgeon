The current environment programs the brain, but the clever brain can choose its upcoming environment.

A human being becomes his environment. It is critical to savagely and surgically arrange one’s environment in accordance with where he wants to go.

Breaking addiction requires a new lifestyle. People struggle with breaking addiction because you have to break the physical addiction, and you also have to change your lifestyle. You have to switch to a lifestyle where you can be happy without that substance.

## External Influence

Addiction holds together fake relationships and fake activities. If I drink to be social and do that enough, I’ll find myself hanging out with people I wouldn’t spend time with otherwise. When I’m sober, I can’t tolerate these people, the topics we discuss or the venues we visit. I can only do it drunk.

It can go the other way as well. Let's say hypothetically all of your friends are linked to you by some sort of debilitating habit. how do you move on from that without being a complete loner? How can you move on from your addiction without survivor's guilt?

This is the exact problem with "communities" based around leaving addictions. If PMO addiction is your common trait, building a community around it means either you become free or you stay with your friends. This creates unneeded pressure. The first rule of handling conflict is don’t hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict.

Self-development is its own bubble. You're surrounded with positive messages. Everyone's telling everyone you're all going to be successful or your gurus are making posts about being happy and blocking out those negative thoughts. But just like any bubble, there's always a burst.

Whether orchestrated or not the self-help world can put you under a massive illusion the illusion of progress. It's only when you take a second to pause and reflect when you realize nothing has changed. Action faking is an even more lethal form of procrastination because you're tricking yourself into thinking that you're actually making progress.

You are more profitable to the self-help industry unhappy and discontent than you are happy and fulfilled.

A lot of what goes on today is what many of you are doing right now—beating yourself up and scribbling notes and saying, “I need to do this, and I need to do that, and I need to do…” No, you don’t need to do anything. All you should do is what you want to do. If you stop trying to figure out how to do things the way other people want you to do them, you get to listen to the little voice inside your head that wants to do things a certain way. Then, you get to be you.

## Looking For Progress

Looking for progress is essentially looking for pleasure. It is the pleasure of self-image, which says, “I’m in a better place now than I was before.”

This is why counting days does not work. Why "looking for benefits" and measuring effectiveness just acts as a substitute for PMO.
