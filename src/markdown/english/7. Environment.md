The current environment programs the brain, but the clever brain can choose its upcoming environment.

A human being becomes his environment. It is critical to savagely and surgically arrange one’s environment in accordance with where one wants to go.

Breaking addiction requires a new lifestyle. People struggle with breaking addiction because you have to break the physical addiction, and you also have to change your lifestyle. You have to switch to a lifestyle where you can be happy without that substance.

If there is a hole in your life where PMO was, then how do you not expect to fill it? If you still crave pleasure and feeling, then you will just fill that hole with another destructive activity. And then what progress is made? One must change lifestyle and perspective for this change.

Whenever there is a lack of understanding of environment there must be conflict. Environment gives birth to conflict, and so long as we do not understand the environment, conditions, surroundings, and are merely seeking substitutions for these conditions, we are evading one conflict and meeting another.

## External Influence

Addiction holds together fake relationships and fake activities. If I drink to be social and do that enough, I’ll find myself hanging out with people I wouldn’t spend time with otherwise. When I’m sober, I can’t tolerate these people, the topics we discuss, or the venues we visit. I can only do it drunk.

It can go the other way as well. Let's say hypothetically all of your friends are linked to you by some sort of debilitating habit ("recovering" together). How do you move on from that without being a complete loner? How can you move on from your addiction without survivor's guilt?

This is the exact problem with "communities" based around leaving addictions. If PMO addiction (or any for that matter) is your common trait, then building a community around it means either you become free or you stay with your friends. This creates unneeded pressure. The first rule of handling conflict is don’t hang around people who are constantly engaging in conflict.

"No-porn" groups and "semen-retention" groups systematically lead people to failure. Not through their purposeful action, but just through the structure of a community itself. First, it creates unneeded pressure. Second, you may ask advice from people that have no idea of what they are talking about. Third, you may try to help people but fail because your only priority should be to help yourself. Fourth, the community may encourage public "streaks" and external rewards rather than internal ones. Fifth, groups never lead to truth but consensus. Basically - except for groups based **solely** around spreading the word, groups like these will hinder and hurt your ability to become free.

Conflicting information is the birth of confusion. And many preach messages that seem credible, that seem legitimate like they know what they are talking about. But I assure you, in the world that we live in, mistruths run everything. Is this "bad"? - For the group? No. For the individual? Yes.

If you look at these groups or forums for a second, you can see the desperation in people. They tell themselves that this time will be different, that this time they will take control of themselves. Yet they change nothing. They change nothing in their understanding, and they repeat the same process. After some time, they have broken so many promises to themselves that they do not even trust themselves. They have no confidence. And if they do, they are likely deluded. If you repeat, rather than iterate (changing something each time), then you are wasting time.

Self-development is its own bubble. You're surrounded by positive messages. Everyone's telling everyone you're all going to be successful or your gurus are making posts about being happy and blocking out those negative thoughts. But just like any bubble, there's always a burst.

Whether orchestrated or not the self-help world can put you under a massive illusion - the illusion of progress. It's only when you take a second to pause and reflect that you realize nothing has changed. Action faking is an even more lethal form of procrastination because you're tricking yourself into thinking that you're actually making progress.

A lot of what goes on today is what many of you are doing right now - beating yourself up and scribbling notes and saying, “I need to do this, and I need to do that, and I need to do…” No, you don’t need to do anything. All you should do is what you want to do. If you stop trying to figure out how to do things the way other people want you to do them, you get to listen to the little voice inside your head that wants to do things a certain way. Then, you get to be you.

This is the very reason I specify not to read this book presuming everything I write is true. Because if you do not critically think about your life; your circumstances; then you can be led to mistruths as easily as you can be led to truths. Learning is done through the individual, not the mentor. The constant assertion of belief is an indication of fear. So learn what is true, and belief is not needed.

## Looking For Progress

Looking for progress is essentially looking for pleasure. It is the pleasure of self-image, which says, “I’m in a better place now than I was before.” This is why counting days does not work. Why "looking for benefits" and measuring effectiveness just act as a substitute for PMO.

Counting days is like trying to do things "one step at a time". But the reality is, you are creating a staircase where there was not one before. Leaving addiction is not a constant self-battle like how people imagine. You do not fight yourself when you have no dissonance such as wanting PMO but wanting freedom at the same time. When the truth hits home, PMO will not even sound good in theory.

## The Degeneration of Contemporary Sexual Dynamics

Over the following years following this book being written, the hypersexualization of society will likely increase drastically.

Degeneracy will become more widespread, as healthy gender roles fall apart. These destroyed dynamics will affect the next generation, who will pay the price.

The human will become obsessed with identity, and delusion of reality will become the norm.

Men will become incredibly weak and feminine due to the constant stimulus and hypersexualization (this also means those who set themselves apart will be very powerful).

The use of AI in hypersexualization will speed these things up also.

This will likely bring gender dynamics and modern men to a breaking point. It will affect women too, but mainly men. This will be inevitable.

Through all of these environmental factors, be a beacon of light for those that are neck deep in hypersexualization. Those who harness their sexual energy will be incredibly powerful as these societal changes happen.

## The Potential of Nootropics (Extra)

Nootropics (potent supplements) have a large potential for speeding up the dopaminergic recovery from porn use, and other addictive activities. While they should not be depended on, and are not necessary, for those that want to utilize them, they can be effective. With time, the research on nootropics will change, and more effective solutions will come out.
