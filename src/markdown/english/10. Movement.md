Many of you may be thankful for this book. You may want to show appreciation but I am not an idol. In the scheme of things, I know nothing, and can grow so much more. And so can you. If you want to thank me, purchase a physical copy for a friend you think may benefit from it, and give opportunity to those who you see in a bad place. Thank you for reading! <3

Burgeon meaning: to grow.
