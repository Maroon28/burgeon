            If you want to help this project, there are many ways you can do this.
            <br><br>
            One way is sharing the <a href="https://burgeonbook.org">https://burgeonbook.org</a> link. If you describe it, describe it as a book, not a guide, as I do not want it being framed as a How-To.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:0px;">What about translations?</h3>
    <div class="cent-container">
        <p style="max-width:550px;font-size: 17px;">
            Translations will be done professionally. It is hard to convey the specific message I want when translating, and if somebody translates the book, I have no idea of quantifying if it conveys the same message as the English version.
            <br><br>
            This is why I will translate it professionally.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:0px;">Groups/Discord Servers?</h3>
    <div class="cent-container">
        <p style="max-width:550px;font-size: 17px;">
            I do not want any groups or discord servers to exist around burgeon. If you do not understand why, you did not read the book. I think groups can exist specifically for promotion but that must be their singular purpose, not for ego-boosting or moping.

    <h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;padding-bottom:0px;">Donating?</h3>
    <div class="cent-container">
        <p style="max-width:550px;font-size: 17px;">
            Another way you can help us is by donating. You can either do this by purchasing a physical copy of burgeon (or multiple).
