    <p style="max-width:650px;">Burgeon is a collection of ideas that hopes to solve problems brought about by good willed people who give bad advice. To create this book, I transcribed and paraphrased many different sources, and I organized them into a structure I found best fit.
    I realised that truth must be found individually. I want to give props to Naval Ravikant, Kapil Gupta MD, and Krishnamurti for giving me clarity on ideas around truth so I could implement them in this book.

    There are many factors to the current cycle most go through. The most annoying (for me) is that bad advice around quitting is already in the minds of readers, so you effectively have to remove two types of brainwashing.
    <br><br>
    Another thing is that bad habits do not exist in isolation. The reason for one majorly contributes to the others (similar instant pleasures). You can not sustainably fix a bad habit, in isolation, from other negative patterns. You have to dig up the root cause for all of them.

    A method of avoidance is purposely looking for edge cases and irrelevant exceptions. Defense mechanisms show themselves in the sneaky ways.

    If you are curious why I bothered to write this book, I wrote it for myself. Others being able to read it is a bonus.
